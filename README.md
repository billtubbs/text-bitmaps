# text-bitmaps
Python module to produce bitmap images containing text for use with small, low-resolution displays such as Papirus e-paper liquid-crystal displays.

Below is photo of a 200 x 96 pixel Papirus e-paper display showing an image generated by this script (see demo below).

<IMG SRC="171001photo_papirusdisplay.jpg">

The font is based on the Mullard SAA5050 chip (dated July 1982) that was used to display text-based information on TV screens. Many thanks to [bjh21](http://bjh21.me.uk/bedstead/) for providing the raw data for the original fonts as well as a large collection of additional unicode characters.

Bitmaps for the following character sets are included here:

ASCII
- fixed
- proportional

Unicode - Basic Latin (ASCII) and Latin-1 Supplement
- fixed
- proportional

The proportional set allow more characters per line because certain characters ('i', 'j', etc) have been trimmed.

## Basic Usage

There are two functions.

```
img = bitmaps.get_char_image(65)
img.show()
```

Produces:
<IMG SRC="ascii/fixed/chr_0x0041.bmp" height="100">


```
text_to_display = "Take this kiss upon the brow!\n" \
                  "And, in parting from you now,\n" \
                  "Thus much let me avow:\n" \
                  "You are not wrong, who deem\n" \
                  "That my days have been a dream;\n" \
                  "Yet if hope has flown away\n" \
                  "In a night, or in a day,\n" \
                  "In a vision, or in none,\n" \
                  "Is it therefore the less gone?\n" \
                  "All that we see or seem\n" \
                  "Is but a dream within a dream."

img, char_count = bitmaps.display_text_prop(text_to_display)
img.show(display)
img.save("eapoe2.bmp")

print("{} of {} characters displayed.".format(char_count, len(text_to_display)))
```

Produces:

<IMG SRC="eapoe2.bmp" width="400">

251 of 305 characters displayed.
